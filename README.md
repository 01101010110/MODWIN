Hello Friends~!

I have built a tool that takes everything I learned from writing this GUIDE https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/how-to-make-your-own-tiny-or-lite-windows-iso.4496967/ 

and turned the process into a simple one click script to build a "tiny" or "lite" windows iso.

Windows 10 and 11 Compatible. UUPDUMP images Supported~!

Please feel free to take these tools and make them into something better, its all open source, and yours now.
